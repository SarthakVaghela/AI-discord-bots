2>>>>>>> EarBender

Smart bot which takes a song name as an input from user and plays that song in the voice chat of discord.

In detail explanation:
-first user types the song name and bot automatically looks it up on web(most probably on YouTube)
-then it uses an third party application to covert that video into MP3 file
-and it outputs the file as a song in voice chat
-this all happens without opening anything at all except discord
-memory efficient and so convenient
