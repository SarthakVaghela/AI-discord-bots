1>>>>>>> AirBender

This bot fetchs real-time weather data using openweatherAPI and displays and output message or a promt to the user.
To activate the bot the prefix is set to '.' and after that user enters the name os the city/state/country
The bot outputs weather in C or F and this measurements can be changed easily by user for better experiance 

2>>>>>>> EarBender

Smart bot whichg takes a song name as an input from user and plays that song in the voice chat of discord.

In detail explaination:
  -first user types the song name and bot autometically looks it up on web(most probably on youtube)
  -then it uses an third party application to covert that video into MP3 file
  -and it outputs the file as a son in ovice chat
  -this all happens without opening anything at all except discord
  -memory efficient and so convenient
